# Third-party-to-Call-Manager

Over the years I have had to connect various third-party calling devices to Cisco's Call Manager (CUCM)

In this Repo I will put configuration recipes for various devices along with interesting ‘catches’ I ran into. Each markdown file will be for a specific device, however similar models may work with the same settings.

Please feel free to open and issue here or send me an email with thoughts/comments/issues/kudos to github *at* SureFireEng.com

Thank you!
